# Cryptocurrency With Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Background

Martha got a chance to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm Accountability Accounting, and I have the chance to help her our using Unsupervised Machine Learning. As we both know the popularity of Bitcoin has caused a price jump and makes it unaffordable for many new investors. However, there are many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. Martha has a data set of cryptocurrencies. My job is to help her discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies. 

## Purpose

For this project, I created data frames, table, visualizations to show what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. First, I processed the data to fit the unsupervised machine learning models. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. Finally, I created data visualizations to share findings with the board. 

There are four sections for this project:

1.	Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2.	Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3.	Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4.	Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
